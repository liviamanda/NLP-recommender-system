## üíæ **Dataset**

The dataset is obtained from a credible source and comprises relevant details regarding airline reviews. For further information or to access the dataset, please refer to the provided source [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juhibhojani/airline-reviews/data).

<br />

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problem Statement**

Choosing the right airline can greatly affect a traveler's overall experience, including comfort, service quality, and in-flight amenities. With many online reviews available, airline passengers often rely on these reviews to make informed decisions about which airline to choose. However, the large number of reviews can make it difficult and time-consuming to read through and understand the general opinion about an airline.

FlightBuddy aims to solve this problem by using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze airline reviews quickly and accurately. By processing and understanding a large number of reviews, FlightBuddy can determine whether the opinions in the reviews are positive or negative.

<br />

## üìå **Objective**

The main goal of FlightBuddy is to improve the decision-making process for travelers by providing personalized airline recommendations based on the analysis of review sentiments. Specifically, FlightBuddy aims to:
- Analyze the sentiment of airline reviews to classify them as positive or negative, with accuracy serving as the metric.
- Recommend five airlines with similar positive characteristics for users who have seen favorable reviews.
- Suggest top-rated alternative airlines for users who have encountered negative experiences, ensuring they have better options for future travel.
